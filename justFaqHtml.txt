                                            A major credit card: Rental car agencies usually require a credit card for
                                            payment and security deposit purposes.
                                            Proof of insurance: Your personal auto insurance policy or a separate rental
                                            car insurance policy may be required. Check with the rental agency for

                                            for added protection. Check with the rental company to understand the
                                            insurance options available and decide what's best for your needs.
